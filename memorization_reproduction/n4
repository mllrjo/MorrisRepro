✅ Enhanced training available - using improved convergence detection
Binary Enhanced Training Fix
Applying discovered optimal settings
====
🧪 TESTING: Binary Memorization Fix
Testing the case that was failing before...
====
Dataset: 4 sequences × 16 bits = 64 total bits
Model: 101,376 parameters
Ratio: 0.0006 bits/param (was failing)

Training with FIXED binary settings...
🔧 Using BINARY-OPTIMIZED enhanced training
   Learning rate: 0.01 (10x higher)
   Weight decay: 0.0 (disabled)
   Using existing enhanced training interface
Using enhanced training with improved convergence detection
Starting enhanced training with 4 sequences
Target: loss < 0.15, max steps: 100000
Step      0: Loss 0.6441, LR 1.00e-04, Time 0.0s
         Memorization rate: 0.000
CONVERGED: HIGH_MEMORIZATION_RATE at step 500
Final loss: 0.0748
Final memorization rate: 1.000
Training completed in 6.1 seconds

📊 FIXED RESULTS:
   Training time: 6.8 seconds
   Final loss: inf
   Converged: False
   Status: unknown
❌ Still not working - needs more investigation
   Expected: Loss < 0.05 and convergence
   Actual: Loss = inf, Converged = False

❌ Basic fix failed - need more debugging
